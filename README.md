Note: The process_gsw_airtemp.ipynb file was for processing GSW and air temperature data for Luana's Wetlands Open Water stuff, for 2015.

The gsw_process.ipynb file is the one that was used to process GSW and air temperature data for 2009-2016 and get it concatenated onto the data frames for the PPR wetlands.
